This testing module is designed to thoroughly test the functionalities
of the FileStorage class, which is responsible for serializing instances
to a JSON file and deserializing JSON files to instances in the context
of a simple object-relational mapping (ORM) system. The module includes
various test classes, each focusing on specific aspects of the FileStorage
class.
